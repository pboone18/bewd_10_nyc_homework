# This exercise will test your knowledge of Variables and Conditionals.
# Secret Number is a game. 
# The purpose of the game is to have players guess a secret number from 1-10.
#
# Wherever you see '___' in the code, that's where work needs to be done.
# Follow the instructions and replace '___' with working code.
#
# To play the game:
# `ruby play.rb` (on the commmand line)
#
# To run the specs (optional):
# `rspec secret_number_game_spec.rb`
